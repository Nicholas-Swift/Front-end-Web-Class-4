## 1 - The Box Model

Elements that display as block take up space as a box on the screen. 
I will use the block and box interchangably. 
The total space a box fills follows a few rules. 

- The dimensions of a box are determined by four features: 
    - width and height
    - padding
    - border
    - margin
- The total width of a box is
    - width + padding + border + margin-left + margin-right
- The total height of a box is
    - height + padding + border + margin-top + margin-bottom

### Default Width and Height

The width and height of a box follow some simple rules. 

- The width of a box is the width of it's container
    - Unless you set the width to a value
- The height of a box is the height of it's content
    - A box with no content is height 0

### Padding

Imagine padding as inside the box. Padding will include any background 
color or background image assigned to a box.

### Border

Borders have three features:

- style
    - solid, dashed, double, etc.
- Color
- width

### Margin 

Margin does not display any background color or background image fill. 
Think of margin as being outside the box. 

Think of margins as pushing neighboring boxes away from each other.

Horizontal margins add, while vertical margins overlap.

## 4 - Float

Float uses a completely different method to position elements on the screen. 
Use float to layout pages where elements have to be positioned side by side. 

You can use float to create many of the layouts you might imagine. 
There are a few situations where float doesn't work. 
For these use absolute or relative position, which we will talk about later.

Float can also be used to wrap text around an image. 

Elements can be floated left or right

- float: left
- float: right

### Demo

...














Absolute and relative position
- Relative
- Absolute
- Relative ancestors 
- left, top, right, and bottom

Transform 
- Translate 
- Rotate
- Scale
- Skew





Typography
- San serif, Serif
    - Fixed width vs variable width fonts
- Baseline, x-height, cap-height
- Line height and character spacing
- Font weight
- Web fonts
    - Google fonts

- Make a style guide (chose one or more the markup examples)
  - Identify each of the uniquely styled elements in your HTML document
    - Use one or more of the projects from the previous class
    - Separate the elements and create specimens in an HTML file
      - Colors
      - Default font style
      - Heading
      - Sub headings
      - Call outs
      - Block quote
      - Image
      - Header
  - Define styles for common text content tags: 
    - p, h1-6, blockquote, strong, em, a
  - Challenge: Style form elements
  - Challenge: Create a sample style guide page with code samples and specimens
    - In order to create code samples in HTML you will to understand 
      - HTML entities
      - Code and pre tags
- Create a style guide for the screenplay. 
  - The best approach here is to use class names for things like: voice-over, screen direction, character name and other things that are specific to screen plays and don’t have an existing tag. 
- Make some really great buttons
  - Use the <button> tag and set the styles to make it look really cool
  - Take a look at the button examples here and see if you can recreate them or make your own version: [https://www.freshdesignweb.com/css3-buttons/](https://www.freshdesignweb.com/css3-buttons/) to recreate these you will need more CSS than we have covered so far, that’s okay, try it on your own and push yourself.
